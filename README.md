# ZetaScout
This is the companion app to allow you to record match data in FRC matches and graph it.

WARNING: It seems to only work properly on old versions of Android. If the app crashes when attempting to export, you can try two things:
- Give the app storage permissions in your device's settings.
- Create a file named "zetascout.json" in your Documents folder that contains the text `{}`.
